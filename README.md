# DesignThinking-Revamp
This repo contains materials related to creating a solution that will ease the transition into design thinking methodology. 

**Problem:**
Currently beginners find the design thinking process difficult, more help and better organization of resources is needed for a smooth transition into this beneficial framework.

### Project Scope

#### Part One: *Outlining*
 - Record problems with current framework
   + Lack of emphasis with the double diamond
   + Overwhelming amount of information without clear projected path
   + No timeline to show progress
     - show loop backs (times when progress has been non-linear)
     - where you currently are in relation to project scope
     - visual representation
   + Better examples for each worksheet is needed 
 - Compare with Mural
   + No timeline
   + Too many options/information
 - *Potential:* Interview current students to identify pain points and review iterations of new framework
   + Ethnographic research
   + Empathy map / feedback maps from interviews
 *If this is being done for schools, take the POC of teacher, consider features they may want to have (i.e. tracking group progress to evaluate students that need more help)*
 
#### Part Two: *Implementing*
 - Create a front end prototype for new/revised application
 - Implement in elm
   + Use [slope template](https://github.com/christopheranand/HC3_2019/tree/master/WidgetTemplate) as inspiration
 - Get feedback, revise
 - Repeat...
 
#### Part Three: *International Fame & Fortune*
  - Publish work to a journal
    + Journal of Design Studies
    + Journal of Design Thinking
